# Vertical-Slider
Vertical photo scroller application

Fun project related to HTML, CSS, and javaScript.
First version contains my family picture. Its basically general implication.
The left side contains information regarding the picture or any phrase and the right side contains the picture. 
The idea behind making this was to create a photo scrolling frame of my family which looks cool. 
I will add more feature to the application and upload it to my website so that I can share what is most important to my life.
